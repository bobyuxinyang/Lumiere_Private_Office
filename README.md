## 💎 Core Value Proposition
**Why LUMIÈRE?**

### 1. Continuous Vigilance (24/7 全天候守护)
Your life doesn't stop at 5 PM. Neither does LUMIÈRE. While you sleep, our agents are:
- Monitoring global airspace for your upcoming flights.
- Syncing health telemetry with your medical team.
- Scanning geopolitical shifts that might affect your assets.
*Evidence: Check the "Operation Logs" in any Agent Profile to see activity from 02:00 AM.*

### 2. Implicit Knowledge (隐性知识捕捉)
We don't ask you to fill out forms. LUMIÈRE listens.
- It understands "I'm feeling heavy" means "adjust the menu to lighter, organic options".
- It remembers your preference for "South-facing suites" from a casual remark three months ago.
*Evidence: The "Client Dossier" automatically updates after every voice interaction.*

### 3. Proactive Execution (主动式危机解除)
Traditional assistants wait for orders. LUMIÈRE acts before the problem touches you.
- **Problem**: Airspace restriction detected for your G650ER route.
- **Action**: Alternative flight path locked and ground transport rerouted *before* you are even notified.
- **Result**: Seamless continuity.
